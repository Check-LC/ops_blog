并没有找到官方比较权威的指标获取工具，来自社区的应用各有所长，使用以下工具，各取其长
## 1. kafka_exporter
下载并执行，获取指标太少，弃用
   
```
nohup kafka_exporter --kafka.server=10.8.0.88:9092 &
```

## 2. [jmx_exporter]( https://github.com/prometheus/jmx_exporter )
### 下载 java-agent, 需要在每个节点配置
```
wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/prometheus/jmx/jmx_prometheus_javaagent/0.20.0/jmx_prometheus_javaagent-0.20.0.jar
```
### 运行方式
#### Running the Standalone HTTP Server（未使用）
#### Running the Java Agent（推荐使用）
在 `kafka-server-start.sh` 头部增加代码声明，agent将和服务共同启动
```
export KAFKA_JMX_OPTS="-javaagent:/usr/local/kafka/bin/jmx_prometheus_javaagent-0.20.0.jar=9990:/usr/local/kafka/config/kafka-jmx.yml"
```

各节点 kafka 已经由 systemd 管理，此处执行 systemctl restart kafka 即可
#### [此处是官方的jmx_exporter使用的 javaagents 配置文件模板](https://github.com/prometheus/jmx_exporter/blob/main/example_configs/kafka-kraft-3_0_0.yml) kafka-jmx.yml
